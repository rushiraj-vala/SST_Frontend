every lines is seperated and indented

problem : creaet a widget that displays multiline text (because can only insert in one line)
    sol : (textbox does not inherently allow inserting at any row, instead go through each num and add that man \n to the string)

problem : The text on same line is also displayed in new lines some times
    sol : from OCR get the distance from top check the change in distance if significant
         then a line otherwise same line

Problem : Cannot add new entry into the dataframe
    sol : create a dict first and then add
            no append func

Problem:  
Problem: the sorted array is taking values of the last row instead of the previous row

Problem: The values are corrected by the grouping is not working

Problem: real time update in gallery

Features:
 -> reactive window of image
 -> reactive text area
 -> Undo
 -> tools in text area: RESET, 


Major overhaul:

-> Shift the frontend to react


Electron:
-> ScreenCapture
    -> Create a button that calls screenShot()
    -> Create a screenShot() -> calls ipcMain thread to run a capture func
    -> Create a CaptureScreen() -> getPrimaryDisplay->get height, width ->  await use desktopCapturer (given in options)-> find source -> access thumbnai() -> return image
    -> CaptureScreen() -> window.webContent.on('had-finish-load') -> window.webContent.send('apikey',imageURL)

-> add screen snip options
: done

-> Send the image to python backend: done
    -> Image being sent is in base64 , try to send image as object along with name: 
    - when sending image as an blob which should be used png or jpeg
    - MIME argument

-> add animations

-> update the first screen: done (use a div that is top,bottom,left,right - 0 with flex property - children button are 100% height and width % )
